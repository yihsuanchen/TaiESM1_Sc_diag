Original VOCALS netcdf file: VOCALS_REx-GFS_SCM_forc-all_times_stations.nc 
IOP netcdf file: /lfs/home/dani/TaiESM_scam/ncinputs/IOP/VOCALS_ST[01:25]_4scam_[sigma,fixedgrid].nc
Scripts used: /lfs/home/dani/TaiESM_scam/scripts/vocals/
create_new_vocals_ncfiles_for_scm.m - no interpolation done, used the default vertical levels
create_new_vocals_ncfiles_for_scm_fixedgrid.m - interpolated the 3D variables to fixed grid


1. Created files for each station

2. Variable Format
   - date/time variables to ‘integer’
   - others to ‘single’

3. Date/time variables- created new variables to be compatible TaiESM ${taiesmfolder}/models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/iop.F90
   - tsec
   - bdate

4. Levels - although original VOCALS netcdf file have time varying vertical levels, TaiESM read this variable once - at initialization. Thus, the IOP file for scm simulation includes the first vertical level only, flipped.

5. Two-dimensionals variables
     - reshaped the dimension to time x lon x lat
     - renamed: psfc to Ps and tsfc to Tg

6. Three-dimensional variables
     - reshaped the dimension to time x lev x lon x lat
     - flipped data to be consistent with the flipped levels
     - renamed t toT, dtdt to divT, and dqdt to divQ
